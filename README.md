# T01-Data-Visualization---Energy-Consumption-Website-
Build a small interactive website that demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the use of a GitHub repository.

1. Add remote link to GitHub.
 ~ git remote add origin https://github.com/tyrdle-coding/T01-Data-Visualization---Energy-Consumption-Website-
 
2. Initialized README.md in repository. Since the remote repository already had this file, I had to pull it before pushing other files.
 ~ git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

3. Add all modified files to the staging area. 
 ~ git add .

4. Write descriptive message for every commit.
 ~ git commit -m "Message here."

5. Upload commits from local machine to GitHub repository.
 ~ git push origin main

GenAI Usage
I used GenAI to provide a guideline, validate ideas, and explain new syntax. All generated code was reviewed, understood, and modified before inclusion.
All fixes and some ideas for task requirement (mostly Javascript) obtained were obtained from Stack Overflow.
GenAI used only for enhancement of code.

GenAI Boundaries
No direct copy-paste of large code blocks without modification and understanding.

Short Reflection
GenAI has helped me build the website faster by providing clear explanations when I got stuck, and helping me detect bugs I couldn't find.
I have reviewed the task's requirements carefully and have not blindly followed the code generated.
Overall, GenAI has helped streamlined the process of building this website efficiently and improved my understanding of the languages used in this task.
