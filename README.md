# T01-Data-Visualization---Energy-Consumption-Website-
Build a small interactive website that demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the use of a GitHub repository.

1. Add remote link to GitHub.
 ~ git remote add origin https://github.com/tyrdle-coding/T01-Data-Visualization---Energy-Consumption-Website-
 
2. Initialized README.md in repository. Since the remote repository already had this file, I had to pull it before pushing other files.
 ~ git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

3. Add all modified files to the staging area. 
 ~ git add .

4. Write descriptive message for every commit.
 ~ git commit -m "Message here."

5. Upload commits from local machine to GitHub repository.
 ~ git push origin main
